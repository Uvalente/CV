## Umberto Valente

I am a newly Full-stack Junior Developer, currently studying at Makers Academy, a selective developer boot camp based in London.

Experienced in managerial roles in the hospitality sector, I have great leadership skills, that I have gained while I was managing and organising teams of people, at the same time I have developed time management skills, that helped me to meet deadlines and focus on the results.

## Skills

#### Team-player

Always open to listening to other people's ideas, offer assistance when needed, and collaborate with colleagues. I enjoy following or leading in equal measure.

#### Attention to detail

Thanks to 10 years of experience in the hospitality sector, I have developed a keen eye for details, thriving under pressure, without ever compromising on quality.

#### Adaptability

Accustomed to working in different environments and with people from diverse backgrounds, I gained the ability to adapt myself and my working strategy to the challenge and the resources at hand.

#### Fast learner

Able to take on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly and efficiently. I actively sought out challenges to improve my knowledge.
