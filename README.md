I am a creative Full-stack Developer, recently graduated from Makers Academy, a selective developer boot camp based in London.

After 10 years in kitchen managerial roles, I translated my team managing abilities to a strict pair programming environment, implementing an agile workflow, working in harmony in all the teams that were assigned during the course.


Being used to work in a stressful career, helped me keep focused on the task at hand, improving the prioritization of the right workload, while meeting strict deadlines.  
That led to successful projects, that we are happy and proud to show, as my final project [***Dinorun***](https://github.com/Uvalente/technodactyl-studios-dinorun), a Single Page App, scrolling platform game built in pure Javascript.

I am currently looking for an opportunity where pair programming is practiced, and where I can further expand my knowledge and skills.

## Skills

### Team-player

Always open to listening to other people's ideas, offer assistance when needed, and collaborate with colleagues, I enjoy following or leading in equal measure.  
I always enjoyed mentoring and sharing knowledge, as well as encouraging my team to feel comfortable in expressing their opinion and boosting team morale.

### Attention to detail

Thanks to 10 years of experience in the hospitality sector, I have developed a keen eye for details, thriving under pressure, without ever compromising on quality.  
That led to enjoying debugging, a skill that I put at good use during my JavaScript game project, finding and fixing bugs in the gameplay and user interactions.

### Adaptability

Accustomed to working in different environments and with people from diverse backgrounds, I gained the ability to adapt myself and my working strategy to the challenge and the resources at hand.  
I am always happy changing my products to meet customer needs, and positively changing a problem approach or product design if a better solution is found.

I actively sought out challenges to improve my knowledge.
