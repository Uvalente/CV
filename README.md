After many years surrounded by hobs and pots, I've hung up my knives and dust off my childhood dream.

Equipped with the same drive and perseverance that allowed me to rise and shine in the culinary world, I embarked on countless hours of self-study and self-improvement.

I honed my skills at Makers Academy, absorbed the agile mentality, and thrived in pair programming.

I admit it wasn't always an easy road, however, the feeling of developing an idea makes up for it.

I found that coding is more than solving a problem or following instructions, it is also about being creative and look out for new perspectives.

During these months, I had the opportunity to work on a few personal and collaborative projects and I am now looking for new exciting and challenging proposals that will boost my expertise and technical skills.

If you would like to learn more about myself and my experience, feel free to reach out or have a look at my newest projects.

## Skills

### Team-player

Always open to listening to other people's ideas, offer assistance when needed, and collaborate with colleagues, I enjoy following or leading in equal measure.  
I always enjoyed mentoring and sharing knowledge, as well as encouraging my team to feel comfortable in expressing their opinion and boosting team morale.

### Attention to detail

Thanks to 10 years of experience in the hospitality sector, I have developed a keen eye for details, thriving under pressure, without ever compromising on quality.  
That led to enjoying debugging, a skill that I put at good use during my JavaScript game project, finding and fixing bugs in the gameplay and user interactions.

### Adaptability

Accustomed to working in different environments and with people from diverse backgrounds, I gained the ability to adapt myself and my working strategy to the challenge and the resources at hand.  
I am always happy changing my products to meet customer needs, and positively changing a problem approach or product design if a better solution is found.

### Fast learner

Able to take on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly and efficiently.  
I actively sought out challenges to improve my knowledge.
